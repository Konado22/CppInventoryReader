# CppInventoryReader
C++ application designed to read input file and count occurrence of words and output to file

## Information
This assignment was completed in one of my current college courses in C++. The goal of this applicaton
is to read an input file and add the words to a map with frequency being the value for each key.
After that information is gathered a menu is provided to read user input and provide different views
of the data. Once the file is done being read a copy of the map is also created in a seperate file 
for view later. In the future i would provide error handling for the application beyond a switch case.
I would also provide a function for calling the menu with a parameter being the input of the user.
